## Description
Using JS, the quiz game loops through 8 questions using multiple choices andwers, that have been put into an array of objects. The game uses local storage to save the scores of the users and input them into a highscores table. The game is playable again after clicking the 'Play Again' button, however, I could not get the timer to restart after a number of tries. The new score does add to the scoreboard.
